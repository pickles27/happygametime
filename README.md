Things I need to do:

-get database to save new game rows
-get basic tictactoe functionality working from server/database

-user authentication
-"new game" button
	-waiting for one more player?

-home page:
	-open games (people waiting for +1 player)
	-scoreboard


tic tac toe:
-when user clicks on ttt button in navbar, before board renders, option is shown: 'start new game?'
-if 'yes' button is clicked, 
	FOR NOW: just start a new game with both players being same person, call this person "dummyX and dummyO"
	LATER: wait for 2nd player. add game to home page and 'open games' tab. let player 2 join.
